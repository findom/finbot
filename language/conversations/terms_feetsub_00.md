Hello Prince :)

I see you are in [Montreal](city). Sir. I go there 2 or 3 times a year. I was there for 10 days in December.

Would love to worship you in person next time I'm there ;)

Well.. I don't know you yet. Don't even know what you look like. Thought I could get to know you and look forward to the next time I'm up there.
* turing/human

But I guess from your responses that you are not interested in actually building something with a slave... I get it. So won't take more of your time. Thanks.
